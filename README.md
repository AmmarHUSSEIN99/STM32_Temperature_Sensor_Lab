# STM32 Temperature Sensor Lab

This project was developed in a group during the course *Electronic Systems for Sensor Acquisition* at Politecnico di Torino.

## 🔍 Overview
The aim was to design, simulate, and test an analog front-end for a Pt1000-based temperature sensor, followed by a PWM-based ADC conversion stage using STM32 microcontroller tools.

## 🧪 Key features
- Analog signal conditioning using op-amps
- Zener voltage reference with comparator
- PWM-based ADC (sawtooth + comparator)
- Use of trimming resistors to reduce error
- Testing with breadboard, function generator, oscilloscope
- LTspice simulation and experimental validation
